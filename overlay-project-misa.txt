add database for user login (3 types of users - notes further below - database currently being used is also further below)
add dashboard after login (feel free to use ezistack type of deisgn)- dashboard will show existing projects and create project button 
when user creates a project then they will name it - they will be able to activate overlay, redirect and exit intent.

Overlay

if user activates overlay they will have option to :

* add url (if they add url they they will simply add url for site to overlay)
* Create overlay Page (see below)

Create Overlay Page

If Create overlay page is clicked then it will open on a new page where user can select template or import from url (similar to ezistack) if user selects template then it will open in grapesjs builder - they can edit and save - tool will then make a zip folder available for user to download and upload to their server and will ask for a URL to where they have uploaded it - this url will now be used as the overlay url

Edit project 

The ability to edit existing projects should be possible 

Limits and restrictions

I would like there to be 3 user level accounts 

Expert - Can create 5 projects - can authorize 5 websites in each project - can work with overlay only (no exit intent or redirect)(they cant work with builder or create overlay page)
Professional - can create 10 projects - Can authoritze 10 websites in each project - they can create Overlay page and work with all features
Enterprise - Can create 50 projects - can authoriize 50 sites in each project - can work with everything
